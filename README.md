# vispy2-sandbox

Discussions, experiments, and proof-of-concept for Vispy 2.0

## VISP

This repo also contains a small Python lib called `visp` (for vis-protocol)
where we define the protocol and provide tools to read/write commands, and validate them.

The `visp` lib can be installed by running `pip install -e .` in the repo root.
